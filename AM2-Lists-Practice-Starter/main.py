# Create a list of the numbers 1 through 20 (without hard-coding the list)


# Create a list of the first 20 even numbers (without hard-coding the list)


# Create a list of the first 10 perfect squares (without hard-coding the list)


# Write a function that takes in two lists and returns the sum of both lists


# Write a function that takes in a list and returns the minimum value in that list


# Write a function that takes in a list and returns the maximum value in that list


# Write a function that takes in a list of lists, and returns the sum of all those lists


# Write a function that takes in a list of lists, and returns a new list made from “flattening” the lists (putting every element from each list into a single list)


# Write a function that takes in a list of lists that returns a new list of all the individual maxes from each list. Can you find a way to use the function that you already made that returns the maximum of a list?
