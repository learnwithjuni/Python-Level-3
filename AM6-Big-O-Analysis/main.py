# f(n) = 12n^2 + n


# f(n) = n - sqrt(n) + 0


# f(n) = 11,000,000n + 5


# f(n) = 1,000,000n - 1,000,000


# f(n) = 1,234,567 + 6 - 5


# f(n) = log(n) + 2


# f(n) = n + log(n)


# These next 3 are challenge problems!

# f(n) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 ... + n (The exact sum is n(n+1)/2)


# f(n, m) = 3log(n) + m^2


# f(n) = 1 + f(n/2)
# f(1) = 0
