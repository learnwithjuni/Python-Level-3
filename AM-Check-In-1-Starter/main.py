# FUNCTIONS

# Ask the user for a word. Print out the middle letters of the word (not including the first and last)

# Ask the user to enter a sentence with at least two words. Print out the second word in the sentence. 


# RECURSION

# What is a recursive function? What are the two key parts of any recursive function? 

# Write a function that takes in a number of rows of a pyramid and returns the number of bowling pins needed to make a pyramid with that number of rows. 

# Write a recursive function to calculate the nth Lucas number. The Lucas numbers are very similar to the Fibonacci numbers because each Lucas number is the sum of the previous two. The only difference is that the Lucas number sequence starts with 2 1 instead of 0 1. The first few Lucas numbers are:  2 1 3 4 7 11 ...

# What will be printed if we call strangeFunction(4)?
def strangeFunction(n):
  print(n)
  if n > 2:
    strangeFunction(n-1)
    strangeFunction(n-2)
# Once you have an answer, uncomment the next line to test if it is correct!
# strangeFunction(4)


# STACKS

# What is a stack? How is it different from a list? 

# Create a stack called nums with the numbers from 1-5 stored in it.

# Add a random number to the top of the stack. Print the stack out. 

# Remove the top element of the stack then print the stack out. 

# Write a function that takes in a string of key presses and returns the word that the key presses produce. A "#" in the key presses represents hitting the backspace button. Here are a few examples: 
# makeWord("hi#") -> "h"
# makeWord("ok##") -> ""
# makeWord("ti#ger") -> "tger"
# makeWord("t###") -> ""
