# Algorithm Comparison 

# You can copy a list with this line of code: list2 = copy.deepcopy(list1)
# You can sort a list in reverse if you write list2.sort(reverse=True)

# Copy over your functions for insertion sort and selection sort here. 



# create a variable for n

# generate a list with n random numbers in it 

# make 3 copies of the list with copy.deepcopy(list1)

# sort and reverse two copies of the list with list3.sort(reverse=True)


# Find the times for all 4 tests (add more if you think of more scenarios)

# selection sort random order
# selection sort on reversed list
# insertion sort random order
# insertion sort on reversed list

# print results
