# Write a function that takes in three numbers and returns the product of the numbers


# Write a function that takes in two numbers and returns their average


# Write a function that takes in a word and a letter as input, and returns how many times that letter occurs in the word


# Write a function that takes in an integer as input, and returns how many digits are 7


# Write a function that takes in two numbers, a and b, and returns a to the power of b


# Challenge: Write a function that takes in a number and returns its factorial


# Challenge: Write a function that takes in an integer, n, and returns the length of the Hailstone sequence starting at n. The Hailstone sequence is as follows:
#   As long as n is not equal to 1,
#     print n
#     if n is an even number, cut n in half
#     otherwise, make n equal to three times itself, plus one
# Ex: 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1, so an input of 10 would give an output of 7 (since there are 7 numbers in total)
