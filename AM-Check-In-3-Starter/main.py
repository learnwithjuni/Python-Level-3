# BUBBLE SORT

# What is Bubble Sort?

# list1 = [4, 8, 2, 1, 10, 0]
# What does the list1 look like after 2 passes of Bubble Sort?
# Ans:

# Change the bubbleSort() function below to be more efficient.
def bubbleSort(lst):
  for i in range(0, len(lst)):
    for j in range(0, len(lst)-1):
      if lst[j] > lst[j+1]:
        temp = lst[j]
        lst[j] = lst[j+1]
        lst[j+1] = temp
  return lst

# MERGE SORT

# What is Merge Sort?

# What is the time complexity of Merge Sort?

# FILE INPUT/OUTPUT

# Ask the user to input a word. Then, write the word letter by letter into an external file.

# Reading from the file that you just created, create a dictionary where the keys are the unique letters of your input and the values are how often those letters occur.

# What's the difference between read() and readlines()?
